  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

  <h2>
    Can I use ShareX to upload?

  <p>Sure thing! <a href="/disgg.json">Just press here.</a></p>
  <p>Import that as a custom uploader and fire away</p>

  </h2>
  <p>A guy called dotJS (<a href="http://dotjs.party">Website</a>)</p>

  <h2>

  <p>Purely Python powered and only depends on Flask. The database is SQLite, works alright on SSD.</p>
  <p>There is also a lot of coffee involved.</p>

  <h2>
    Where can I donate?
